# Android RemoteControl for Lego® Mindstorms

## Introduction
My first xamarin project and it was intended for learning xamarin.forms and its binding stuff.
Thanks to Anders Soborg for providing a C#-wrapper for the Lego® Mindstorms API which made the learning process much more interresting.

## Made with

* Xamarin.Android 25.4.0.2 
* Xamarin.Forms 2.5.0.280555 
* VisualStudio for Windows
* [MonoBrick from Anders Soborg](https://github.com/AndersSoborg/MonoBrick-Communication-Software)
